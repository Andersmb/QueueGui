- Look at your job history in color code. You decide how far back you want to go.
- Comes with output file parsers for Gaussian16, ORCA 4.1.2, and MRChem 2.0
- Plot SCF convergence of MRChem jobs, and geometry convergence of Gaussian/ORCA jobs
- Open output files with your favorite visualizer
- The ToolBox comes with additional features:
  - Extract optimized geometries
  - Randomly displace coordinates (you set the scale factor)
  - Displace coordinates as defined by a normal mode (usually imaginary)
  - Extract normal mode information from ORCA .hess file for easy visualization in Molden
- Easily convert between .xyz and Gaussian input formats
- Easily convert XYZ files between Angstr√∂m and Bohr
- Customize by setting colors and fonts!

#### Installation

1. Download the git repository to your location of choice.

2. In order to set your own preferences, QueueGui expects a file called `settings.json` to be located in `~/.QueueGui`. You need to create this file (it can be empty). On MacOS you can run in the terminal

```bash
mkdir $HOME/.QueueGui
touch $HOME/.QueueGui/settings.json
```

3. You will probably need to install some dependencies. No automatic way of doing this exists at this time, so you should just try to run the application and look at the errors you get. Then use `pip`to install the latest versions. 

4. To run the application, navigate in your terminal to the directory `QueueGui/queuegui` in the project you downloaded from Github. To run the application, run in your terminal the following:

   ```bash
   python3 queuegui.py
   ```

#### Requirements

- Python3 (developed with version 3.8, but other 3.x versions are also likely to work)

- `paramiko` for establishing SSH and SFTP connections

- `tkinter` for the GUI

- `matplotlib` for plotting

- `json` for reading/writing settings to file

- `tempfile` for making temporary directories that store files downloaded from the remote cluster

- `requests` for sending HTTP requests to Github when checking for updates
